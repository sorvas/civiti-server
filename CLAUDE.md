# CLAUDE.md - Civica Project Intelligence

This file provides essential context for Claude agents working on the Civica project. It references and coordinates all project documentation to ensure consistent, high-quality development.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Civica** is a civic engagement platform for Romanian citizens to collectively pressure local authorities through coordinated email campaigns. 

### Current Project State
- **Frontend**: ✅ READY FOR INTEGRATION - Angular application with mock services, ready to connect to backend
- **Backend**: 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT - .NET 10 Minimal API with Supabase Auth and PostgreSQL/MongoDB

The frontend is feature-complete with mock services but will continue to evolve as we:
- Integrate with the real backend API
- Add new features based on backend capabilities
- Refine UI/UX based on real data and user feedback
- Optimize performance with actual API responses

### Completed Features (December 2024)
- **User Registration System** with Google OAuth and email/password options (mocked)
- **Issue Creation Workflow** where registered users can report civic issues
- **AI-Enhanced Descriptions** (mocked) for issue text generation
- **Gamification System** with points, badges, and achievements
- **Admin Approval Interface** for issue moderation

### Backend Tech Stack (Next Phase)
- **.NET 10 Minimal API** with C# 14
- **Supabase Auth** for authentication
- **PostgreSQL** (primary) or MongoDB
- **Railway** for deployment

## 📁 Critical Documentation Structure

**ALWAYS consult these files in order:**

1. **`docs/project/Implementation.md`** - Mandatory implementation standards, rules, and backend architecture
2. **`docs/design/ux.md`** - User journey specifications and flow requirements  
3. **`docs/design/Colour-Scheme.md`** - Color palette with CSS/SCSS variables
4. **`docs/design/Typography-Guide.md`** - Fira Sans implementation standards
5. **`docs/guides/Super_Claude_Docs.md`** - SuperClaude framework usage guide

**Additional Technical Docs:**
- **`docs/technical/GOOGLE_MAPS_SECURITY.md`** - Maps API security
- **`docs/technical/README_GOOGLE_MAPS.md`** - Maps integration guide
- **`docs/README.md`** - Documentation structure overview

**New Feature Documentation:**
- **`docs/design/user-registration-ux-research.md`** - UX research for user system
- **`docs/design/user-registration-ui-design.md`** - UI specifications for new features

### Documentation Update Protocol

**MANDATORY for ALL agents**: Documentation is a living part of the codebase and MUST be maintained.

When making ANY changes:
1. **Update existing MD files** in the `docs/` folder immediately after code changes
2. **Create new documentation** if no suitable file exists for your changes
3. **Keep all docs synchronized** - if your change affects multiple areas, update all relevant docs
4. **Use Task tool** to track documentation updates as part of your workflow
5. **Validate accuracy** before committing - documentation must match implementation

#### Documentation Structure
```
docs/
├── project/           # Project-wide documentation (Implementation.md, etc.)
├── design/           # UX/UI specifications and design decisions
├── technical/        # Technical guides and architecture docs
├── guides/           # How-to guides and tutorials
├── api/              # API documentation (to be created for backend)
└── deployment/       # Deployment and operations docs (to be created)
```

#### When to Update vs Create New Documentation
**Update existing files when:**
- Adding features to existing components
- Modifying existing workflows
- Changing implementation details
- Updating technical specifications

**Create new files when:**
- Adding entirely new systems or modules
- Documenting new architectural decisions
- Creating guides for new processes
- Adding API endpoint documentation

**File naming convention**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `backend-api-design.md`, `supabase-integration-guide.md`)

### Backend Development Workflow

#### Phase 1: Architecture & Planning
```bash
# Backend architecture planning
"Use backend-architect agent to:
1. Analyze Implementation.md backend requirements
2. Design detailed API specification
3. Create database schema with migrations
4. Plan Supabase Auth integration
5. Define Railway deployment strategy
6. Create development roadmap for csharp-expert"
```

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation
```bash
# Backend implementation by csharp-expert
"Use csharp-expert agent to implement based on backend-architect's plan:
1. Create .NET 10 Minimal API project structure
2. Implement Supabase Auth integration
3. Build core API endpoints (auth, issues, users, admin)
4. Set up PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
5. Implement business logic and validation
6. Add comprehensive error handling"
```

#### Phase 3: Testing & Optimization
```bash
# Quality assurance workflow
"Coordinate multiple agents:
- Use test-writer-fixer to create API tests
- Use performance-benchmarker for load testing
- Use csharp-expert to fix any issues
- Use devops-automator for deployment setup"
```

### Frontend-Backend Integration Workflow

```bash
# Continuous integration approach
"As backend endpoints become available:
1. Use frontend-developer to update services incrementally
2. Replace mock calls with real API calls one at a time
3. Add error handling for real-world scenarios
4. Update UI based on actual API responses
5. Use test-writer-fixer for integration tests
6. Iterate based on findings"
```

### Frontend Enhancement Workflow

```bash
# Frontend continues to evolve
"While backend is being developed:
1. Use ui-designer to refine components based on feedback
2. Use frontend-developer to add new features
3. Use performance-benchmarker to optimize
4. Use ux-researcher to validate improvements
5. Keep mock services updated for unimplemented endpoints"
```

## 📋 Common Backend Tasks

### Creating API Endpoints
```csharp
// Minimal API pattern
app.MapGet("/api/issues", async (IIssueService service) =>
{
    var issues = await service.GetAllAsync();
    return Results.Ok(issues);
})
.RequireAuthorization()
.WithName("GetIssues")
.WithOpenApi();
```

### Supabase Auth Integration
```csharp
// JWT validation middleware
builder.Services.AddAuthentication()
    .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.Authority = builder.Configuration["Supabase:Url"];
        options.Audience = builder.Configuration["Supabase:AnonKey"];
    });
```

### Database Operations
```csharp
// Entity Framework Core pattern
public class IssueService : IIssueService
{
    private readonly CivicaDbContext _context;
    
    public async Task<Issue> CreateAsync(CreateIssueDto dto)
    {
        var issue = new Issue { /* mapping */ };
        _context.Issues.Add(issue);
        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
        return issue;
    }
}
```

### API Endpoints (To Be Implemented)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `GET /api/issues` - Get all issues
- `POST /api/issues` - Create new issue
- `GET /api/issues/{id}` - Get issue details
- `PUT /api/issues/{id}/email-sent` - Track email sent
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/user/profile` - Update profile
- `GET /api/admin/pending-issues` - Admin: get pending
- `PUT /api/admin/issues/{id}/approve` - Admin: approve
- `PUT /api/admin/issues/{id}/reject` - Admin: reject

### Environment Variables (Railway)
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=xxx
JWT_SECRET=xxx
```

**Important Configuration Note**: 
- The application now uses dependency injection for Supabase configuration
- Environment variables take precedence over appsettings.json values
- Configuration flow: ENV vars → appsettings.json → Exception if neither configured
- SupabaseConfiguration is registered as singleton and injected into services
- Empty strings in appsettings.json ensure environment variables are always used in production

## 📝 Documentation Requirements for ALL Agents

**EVERY agent MUST maintain documentation**:
1. **Before starting work**: Check if relevant documentation exists in `docs/`
2. **During development**: Track what documentation needs updating
3. **After completing work**: Update all affected documentation
4. **If documentation is missing**: Create new files in the appropriate `docs/` subfolder

**Documentation is NOT optional** - it's part of the definition of "done" for any task.
